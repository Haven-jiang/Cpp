Nowadays,young employees have a tendency to switch professions in a yearly basis and many believe that this has a beneficial impact on their income. I think this alternation has more merits than demerits. In this essay, I will describe several reasons and explain reasons.
The main reason for this change is a better opportunity. In the modern society, almost youngsters have gone to college to become qualified and competent.

However, this action enhances workers’ ability and affecting society development. This helps the society to eliminate incompetent employees and acquire passionate, sufficient workers for the field.
In conclusion, regarding the factor that influence young workers’ decision, it is more advantageous to change professions after a certain amount of time.
